# Direct FM Transmitter (80-115 MHz)

A component-level FM transmitter designed from scratch to demonstrate RF system design and PCB layout skills for applications in low-power, narrowband wireless communication.

## Project Overview

As of revision MK4, the system has been fully re-engineered to prioritize **manufacturability, affordability, and modular signal control**. The transmitter features:

- A **free-running VCO** directly modulated with an analog signal to produce wideband FM
- A **TI LMK61E2 programmable oscillator** used in place of a PLL synthesizer, simplifying the frequency control architecture while maintaining tunability and spectral stability
- A **mixer stage** that upconverts the modulated VCO signal using the oscillator output, enabling frequency offset generation
- A flexible **filtering stage**, configurable between a custom-designed 3‚Äì5 pole Butterworth bandpass filter and a wideband SAW filter depending on use case
- A **transformer balun** to convert 200‚ÄØŒ© differential signals to 50‚ÄØŒ© single-ended, improving impedance matching for the final power amplifier
- A two-stage **low-power RF amplifier chain** redesigned for improved linearity and thermal stability under higher output drive
- A **programmable digital potentiometer** in the VCO modulation path to dynamically adjust FM deviation and bandwidth
- An **on-board microcontroller interface** with tuning knob for real-time center frequency control
- Full **impedance matching** between all major blocks using standard-value passives and Pi attenuators to ensure operation within amplifier P1dB
- A layout optimized for **low-cost 4-layer PCB fabrication**, using only **common, non-exotic components** to minimize BOM cost and unique part count for low-volume assembly services like JLCPCB
- RF test points and SMA-tapped outputs for validation and debugging

The complete signal chain was simulated, measured, and iteratively refined based on real VNA and spectrum analyzer results, making this project both a learning platform and a functional RF transmitter.
